# Laravel Dev

A Laravel package that allows you to launch and manage all your development servers and commands in separate terminal windows with a single Artisan command.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üöÄ Launch all your development servers & commands with a single command.
-   ‚ûï Create and manage commands at runtime, not just from the config file.
-   üñ•Ô∏è Each process runs in a new, separate terminal window.
-   üé® Customize terminal colors for each command for better visual organization.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è Interactive menu to start, stop, or restart individual or all commands while running.
-   ‚úÖ Cross-platform support for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üì¶ Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require maherremita/laravel-dev --dev
```

Next, publish the configuration file using the `vendor:publish` command. This will create a `config/laravel_dev.php` file in your project.

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="maherremita\LaravelDev\LaravelDevServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## Usage

### 1. ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Your Commands



Open the `config/laravel_dev.php` file and define the commands you want to manage. You can add as many as you need.

#### Static Commands

Define your commands as usual in the `commands` array:

```php
'commands' => [
    // Simple format
    'Laravel Server' => 'php artisan serve',
    'Queue Worker' => 'php artisan queue:work',
    // Advanced format with custom colors
    'Vite Dev Server' => [
        'command' => 'npm run dev --watch',
        'colors' => [
            'text' => 'Green',
            'background' => 'Black'
        ]
    ],
],
```

#### Dynamic Commands

You can also generate commands at runtime, e.g. from the database or other sources. Use the `dynamic_commands` array for this. Each entry contains PHP code as a string, which is evaluated at runtime and must return an array of commands (like the `commands` array above).

**Example:**

```php
'dynamic_commands' => [
    'colored_commands' => 'array_reduce(
        range(1, 3),
        function ($carry, $number) {
            $carry["Task {$number}"] = [
                "command" => "echo Executing task {$number}",
                "colors" => ["text" => "green", "background" => "black"]
            ];
            return $carry;
        },
        []
    );',
    // ...
]
```

**Notes:**
- The PHP code is executed with `eval()` and must return an associative array.
- Quotes must be escaped (`\'` or `\"`).
- The code must end with a semicolon (`;`).


### 2. üöÄ Run the Dev Command

Start the master command by running:

```bash
php artisan dev
```

This will launch all the commands defined in your configuration file, each in its own terminal window. You will then see an interactive menu in the original terminal allowing you to manage these processes.

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è Manage Your Processes

Once running, you can choose from the following actions:
-   `show all commands`: Display a list of all configured commands.
-   `start command`: Start a configured command that is not currently running.
-   `start all commands`: Start all configured commands.
-   `stop command`: Stop a specific running command.
-   `stop all commands`: Stop all currently running commands.
-   `restart command`: Restart a specific running command.
-   `restart all commands`: Stop and then start all configured commands.
-   `refresh commands`: Reload the configuration and update the list of commands.
-   `exit`: Exit the interactive menu and stop managing processes.


## üé® Available Colors

You can set the `text` and `background` colors for each terminal window.

-   **Windows**: `Black`, `DarkBlue`, `DarkGreen`, `DarkCyan`, `DarkRed`, `DarkMagenta`, `DarkYellow`, `Gray`, `DarkGray`, `Blue`, `Green`, `Cyan`, `Red`, `Magenta`, `Yellow`, `White`.
-   **macOS**: `black`, `white`, `red`, `green`, `blue`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `yellow`.
